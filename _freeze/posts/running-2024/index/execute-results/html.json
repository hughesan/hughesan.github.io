The shape of my year was driven by two marathon training cycles: a 16-week cycle for the Eugene Marathon at the end of April (4/28/24), and an 18-week cycle for the Richmond Marathon held in November (11/16/2024).\n\n<!-- note - need geom_text and geom_rect not annotate to put on specific facets - note geom_rect is a bunch of rects: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11889625/annotating-text-on-individual-facet-in-ggplot2 -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Ground contact time\n\nGround contact time (GCT) is the amount of time the foot spends planted on the ground while running; reduce it and you garner free speed. I credit a simple plyometrics routine and a form cue to drive the feet downward when running with no active pulling up, instead letting forward swing be passive after hip extension (like a slingshot). I was happy to see it gradually decrease after I started implementing this cue around March.\n\nInexplicably, my GCT started to deteriorate in the weeks before and especially after the Richmond Marathon. On many of these runs, both tapering and then slowly resuming running, I was telling myself to slow down (this was especially frustrating during the taper, because I felt fresh and couldn't seem to reign it in). \n\nI do wonder if changing mechanics set the stage for my ITBS, which started in late December.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n",
