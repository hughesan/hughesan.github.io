Hello! I'm a statistician, neuroscience PhD, and avid runner. I started this blog to have somewhere to write. I imagine that most of what I'll write about here is in the area of running and stats, but I'm not going to set any bounds on that.

Pictured here is Cauchy, our heavy-tailed nebelung cat. I like to run laps, but he prefers to sit in them.
