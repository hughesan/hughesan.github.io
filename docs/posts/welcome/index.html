<p>I’m 18 weeks out from the 2025 Boston Marathon! Boston will be my third and hilliest marathon. Here’s how I’m planning to train for it.</p>
<section id="my-history-with-training-plans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-history-with-training-plans">My history with training plans</h2>
<p>For my first marathon, the Eugene Marathon in April 2024, I used <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/advanced-1-marathon">Hal Higdon’s Advanced-1 plan</a>. This was my first time following a training plan of any type, though I only really followed the marathon pace workouts and the long run progression, letting myself fill the rest of the week with whatever easy mileage I desired rather than the miles stipulated by HH. I also included one weekly threshold run that included 20 minutes at threshold. On the weeks of the 20-milers, my weekly mileage reached just over 55 miles, with most other weeks being somewhere in the 45-52 mile range.</p>
<p>The race went well enough for a first time - I finished, I didn’t get injured, I qualified for Boston (!) - but I felt my pace slow in the last 4 miles and I was interested in ways to overcome this. I had read about plans that combine marathon pace work with long runs and I thought this approach might help. A little searching brought me to <em>Advanced Marathoning</em> by Pfitzinger &amp; Douglas, a book of training plans beloved by the folks over at r/AdvancedRunning.</p>
<p>I decided to follow a so-called “Pfitz” plan for my second marathon, which was the Richmond Marathon held in November. I chose the 18-week 55 mile plan, which peaks at 55 miles per week (mpw) but starts much lower at 33 mpw. I had been running ~40 mpw for about 7 years before I started training for Eugene, and was back to a base level of 45 mpw before training for Richmond. For the first few weeks of the plan, which were lower in mileage, I followed the plan workouts and added easy miles as needed to stay at or above my 45 mpw base until the plan’s increasing weekly mileage caught up to my own.</p>
<p>Pfitz 18/55 was a great plan. I followed the workouts, but like my experience with HH, I didn’t stringently follow the miles scheduled on easy/recovery days because (I don’t really think it matters and) I like flexibility. I also didn’t follow the tune-up races with long runs, simply because I keep my running week Sunday - Saturday (Pfitz plans are written Monday - Sunday) and there are no races on Fridays, at least where I live. My favorite part of the Pfitz plan was the inclusion of mid-week medium-long runs of 11-12 miles - I felt like these really helped my endurance. I questioned the weekly VO2max track work in the final weeks of the plan and often only completed 1/2 of the reps and then hit my local hill for some strides. All in all, the plan delivered and I shaved 13 minutes off of my Eugene time. The last 6 miles were among my fastest, too, which was what I was hoping to achieve with Pfitz.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-am-i-going-to-do-differently-this-time" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-am-i-going-to-do-differently-this-time">What am I going to do differently this time?</h2>
<p>In adding easy miles to Pfitz 18/55, my peak mileage reached 65 mpw and I had 3-4 weeks around 58-62 mpw. The next step up in the Pfitz plan series are the 70 mpw peak plans (18/70 and 12/70). For Boston, I plan to follow the 18/70 plan. I didn’t feel overly fatigued or ever struggle to complete workouts in the 18/55 plan, even with the additional mileage and ending most long runs with a decent chunk at marathon pace. I’m nervous to add mileage because I’m terribly afraid of injury but excited to make the leap and see how much adding volume makes a difference in my time.</p>
<p>Still, I can’t seem to follow a plan without putting my own spin on it, so I’m going to make some modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This plan includes doubles, but it’s not high enough mileage to warrant doubles (imo) so I’m not going to do the doubles. Scheduled doubles are 6 miles am + 4 miles pm. I’ll probably just run between 6-10 miles and call it good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>I scaled the total weekly miles down just a bit by multiplying each week by a factor of 67.5/70. So, I’ll actually peak at 67.5 mpw, and several weeks will be in the 63-66 mpw range. As for where to reduce miles to achieve this, I’ll reference the 18/55 plan and make sure I don’t change any workouts that are conserved between the plans (e.g., the LT/threshold workouts are identical between the plans, with the 18/70 LT workouts including 1 additional non-LT easy mile). I’m likely to drop a mile from a mid-week 15 miler, or a mile or two from a recovery run.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-about-strength-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-strength-work">What about strength work?</h2>
<p>For the past couple years I have been in a good groove with strength training and generally train 3x per week following shorter runs. There are different perspectives on when to schedule strength work, but a more common viewpoint is that “easy days should be easy, and hard days should be hard”, i.e.&nbsp;do strength training after speedwork or an otherwise hard run. I’m not going to challenge this directly, but over time I have found myself favoring strength work on short days for reasons of both time management and load management.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of Pfitz 18/70 vs 18/55 is the number and placement of the workout days (by which I mean anything that isn’t a recovery run). Generally, 18/70 has 4-5 workout days per week, and most of these are medium-long or long runs. I generally don’t have time to add 30-50 minutes of strength work after 1h30 - 2h of running. But it’s also said that strength work shouldn’t take place the day before speedwork or a long run, which knocks out most of the days of the week.</p>
<p>I’m tentatively going to continue doing strength work on recovery days, because it has worked for me this far and I’m almost never sore to a point that my running is compromised. I’ll probably do a post about strength training at some point because I’ve come to really enjoy it.</p>
