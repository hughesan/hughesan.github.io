Cauchy is my heavy-tailed nebelung cat pictured above - I like to run laps, but he prefers to sit in them.\nAn impetus for starting this blog was a particularly bad case of IT band syndrome I had in the first half of 2025. I was desperate to read stories from others who had dealt with this condition and I wasn’t satisfied with the limited number of personal accounts that were turning up in my searches. I decided I would contribute my own story and anything else running-related that I felt like writing about. Thanks for stopping by!"

The authors state in the discussion section that antihistamines reduce gains in fitness by half - as far as I can tell, this 8.9% vs 18% increase in peak power is the inspiration behind the word “half”. However, the statistical test for the between-group comparison is not significant (interaction p = 0.42) so the conclusion that blockade impeded peak power development is not statistically supported. The wide confidence intervals for the within-group effects show us that individual responses to training in both groups were quite variable. However, they do note that when the data are analyzed as per-week rates of improvement, the difference between the groups is significant even if the degree of improvement relative to baseline did not differ between groups. VO2peak also increased in both groups over time; the degree and rates of improvement were not different between antihistamine blockade and the control groups."

The number of capillaries per fiber increased over time across all fiber types in both the blockade and control groups. However, when they looked at a metabolic enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase (complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain), they found a stark blunting of enzyme activity in the fibers of the antihistamine group but not in the control group. For slow type I fibers, the SDH activity in the antihistamine group was improved by 2.5% (95% CI: −69.2-74.2%) but was improved by 136.0% (95% CI: 79.2-192.8%) in the control group.

    "text": "First, how not to be active with ITBS\nMy ITBS started just over 13 weeks ago and I spent the first 8 weeks making it as severe as possible. I once woke up at 1:30 am with incinerating knee pain and hobbled out of bed to book another ortho appointment. I had been so desperate to maintain cardiovascular fitness that I was biking or using the elliptical most days and running on non-consecutive days as often and as much as tolerable. I had read the advice on exercising with ITBS and I thought I knew the rule: stop if you have pain. The problem was, I had managed to interpret this as: every day, push until you have pain, then stop. No!\nThis was problematic because of something I’ve come to think of as “pain-creep”: I was always in a little bit of pain, so it was hard to gauge when activities were causing additional pain. I didn’t generally have much additional pain using the elliptical, but by tracking my daily pain in a calendar spreadsheet with color-coded cells depicting my level of pain, I noticed that I was having especially painful days the day after my elliptical sessions.\nIn addition to the day-after pain lag, I was also engaged in so many different activities that it was difficult to tell which activities were problematic. I was initially convinced that the elliptical was more agreeable with me than the stationary bike because I had pain at the end of bike sessions but not at the end of elliptical sessions of similar length. Early on, I could bike on a stationary bike for 90 minutes with only mild ITBS pain starting up toward the end. This was surprising to me because ITBS is also a cycling injury; I didn’t understand how it didn’t seem to trigger the pain I would feel within 2 minutes of running. I took this as permission to bike as much as I wanted. Gradually, however, the walls closed in, and my sessions shrank to 50 minutes, 30 minutes, and on my worst day, just 3 minutes of cycling before pain came on.\nWhen I did try to run every few days, I knew about the recommended run/walk intervals but wasn’t convinced that I needed to go as short as these programs sometimes begin (for example, 1 min running, 2 min walking). Instead, I typically tried to run in 5-8 minute segments separated by a few minutes of walking. I would have mild pain start in the first run segment, but I would try to complete as many segments as possible before the pain felt like it was more than the amount of pain I started with (pain-creep problem). I would also try to push for more time running than the previous time to give myself the illusion of progress. I always had a heightened level of pain after running, sometimes for another day or two, with occasional stabbing pains punctuating the ever-present deep ache along the side of my knee."

    "text": "Changing course\nThe day I could only bike for 3 minutes without pain was the day it really sank in that I wasn’t managing my ITBS correctly, and it sucked to realize I had floundered pointlessly for 8 weeks. I should mention that I had been doing ITBS-targeted strength training during this time, so it wasn’t all counterproductive. But I was continuing to anger my knee day after day with a jumble of activities and the pain had mounted to a level in which I was always in some kind of deeply aching state, with random stabbing pains that sometimes even woke me up at night. I decided that I would simplify my approach by only allowing myself to bike pain-free so that I would be able to see clear evidence of progress if I managed to stay on the bike longer without pain. The problem, of course, is that I was still biking until reaching pain. After my 3 minute ride day, I found myself reaching 15, 20, 30, 35 minutes on the following rides - and then 25, 20, 20, as the walls closed in on me again."

    "text": "A chatGPT rehab approach\nAround this time I got an MRI which confirmed ITBS (a friend had freaked me out about this possibly being a meniscus injury) and I went to a physical therapist for a movement screen, which (frustratingly) suggested that my ITBS leg is actually a little bit stronger than my unaffected leg. I complained to chatGPT about my 9 weeks with ITBS. I told it about my movement screen and strength training but that my ITBS was not clearing up and I needed a plan to get back on my feet. It gave me a plan:\n\nPhase 1: Absolute rest from aggravating movements for 2 weeks, then\nPhase 2: Try pool running or a short cycling session (5-10 min), and if no pain, take another day off, and then\nPhase 3: Try 5 repeats of running 30 seconds, walking 2 minutes\n\nI was at the end of my rope, so I decided to follow this plan starting with 2 weeks of rest. ChatGPT said walking would be fine if it didn’t provoke symptoms, so I went on short walks most days. Day by day, I returned to this same chat session and updated chatGPT with my progress and how I was feeling. By day 5 I could descend stairs normally with only minimal pain (this had been my most disruptive daily-life symptom and I had been going down stairs backwards for months). I was having weird aches and pains during this time, higher up in the lateral quad, and around the fibular head and Gerdy’s tubercle - just short-lived sensations that chatGPT reassured me were part of the “rebalancing process” and not to worry unless they got worse. On day 8, I had to jog a few steps to make it across a crosswalk, and I was disappointed to find that I instantly had a resurgence of ITBS knee pain during those jogging steps. ChatGPT encouraged me to stay the course and asked if I had any lingering pain when walking afterwards - I did not! - to which it pointed out that this was a positive sign.\nBy day 11, I was feeling really pain-free and normal. I had had a couple days with no pain on stairs and could walk for miles without consequence. I was eager and nervous to soon try a potentially aggravating activity when I faced an unexpected hiccup in my plan: on the morning of day 12, I slipped backwards and fell down the stairs on my spine and hip (non-ITBS side). Thankfully nothing was fractured, but the bruising and swelling caused my (good) leg to tingle and ache deeply when trying to stand up so I was immobilized on the couch. My husband had a half-marathon race a few days later that I couldn’t go watch him at because I couldn’t walk. It ultimately took 9 days for me to return to standing comfortably and outdoor walking."

Because of my back injury, it had been 3 full weeks of no aggravating activity and I was excited to try running again.\nI decided to search for return to run plans, since chatGPT had only given me that one initial walk-run workout. There are myriad return to run plans on the web, but they’re pretty varied. Some are clearly for people returning from some type of injury and others don’t say and may just be for people coming back from a break. Does it matter? I thought it might, since when I had been unsuccessfully running with ITBS I learned quickly that shorter intervals were more tolerable than longer intervals.\nI turned to the ITBS literature and read about rehab approaches. Beyond some investigation into hip exercises, there hasn’t been much work devoted to the process of returning to run with ITBS. I found one paper (McKay et al, 2020) that included a return to run plan that was used with a cohort of 24 female runners with ITBS; although results in the paper focus on outcomes from different exercises, the paper does note that none of the runners experienced a recurrence of symptoms during the study. So, with no other ITBS-specific plan out there, I decided I would follow the plan in this study. Because the first run/walk is so similar to the chatGPT suggestion I had been planning on starting with, I opted to just follow this plan instead.\n\n\n\nReturn to run program from McKay et al., 2020. The criterion for starting the program is being able to do a 30-min fast walk without pain. Further details in the paper"

The runs have been going better than expected in some ways, but new challenges are arising. I am thrilled to be outside again, and despite feeling out of breath and not very smooth I do actually feel strong, sturdy, and snappy - in my head I feel that I am running pretty well. My Garmin metrics back this up: my cadence, ground contact time, and vertical oscillation are similar to what they were pre-ITBS. My stride length is a little longer but I have no sense of pace yet and am running a little faster than I should be, but working on it. My heart rate spiked like crazy during the first few run/walk days but is starting to look more typical.\nI haven’t had any ITBS pain while running (if I do I plan to stop immediately), but after runs I am having a lot of pain paranoia and - I think (???) - brief uncomfortable sensations in the area where I used to have IT band pain. It’s really hard to distinguish between my idle intense focus on the area, always listening for any pain signal, and actual discomfort. Also, my knee pops a lot and I don’t remember if it did this pre-ITBS. But I can still descend stairs without any pain, which seems like a good indicator that I haven’t run myself into the depths of ITBS hell again yet. Stay tuned."

Inflammation management during return to run is critical. I set a rule for myself that the day before a planned run should be basically symptom-free, otherwise I need to wait another day.

Instead, after completing 4.5 minutes running, 30 seconds walking (repeated 6x), I spent a total of 6 weeks running about 30-35 minutes total every other day or every couple of days - adding an extra rest day if I woke up on a planned “run” day with any lingering irritation - with runs broken up into longer intervals than the McKay plan contains before the 30 minute continuous run. For example, I had a run of 5 x 6min run intervals with a minute or two walking as needed to avoid stretches of road containing noticeable descents or left turns (my ITBS is on my left leg). I built the run segments up to 10 minutes running x 3, and then 15 minutes x 2, and then tried running continuously after doing that a few times. This may have been more prolonged than necessary in terms of endurance, but I found the walk interval(s) nice for checking in with how my knee was feeling and for a pace reset if I was running too fast."

For scheduling, I followed the structure outlined in Ohio State University’s Advanced Return to Running protocol (link), specifically this part:\n\nI did not follow the mileage prescribed in this plan, because with the amount of time I had taken off at this point this rate of build-up was not appropriate for me, but it may be a good fit for someone who took fewer weeks/months off running. What I did value is seeing the patterning of consecutive run days. Starting in the third week of continuous running, there is a pair of back-to-back runs, followed by every other day running for two runs, another pair of consecutive runs, and then two more every other day runs, before switching to two days on / 1 day off, and finally ramping up to three consecutive days. I have now had three weeks with a pair of consecutive run days, and am looking forward to moving up to repeated two days on / 1 day off soon."

I do think trying things helped keep me optimistic. Since I have ultimately gotten better, I don’t know if what I’m doing now actually helped or if it was just coincidental.\n\nI stopped doing Bulgarian split squats. These are supposed to be an amazing move for runners and prior to me getting hurt, they were the only exercise I was doing for glute strength. However, I don’t think I was performing them well and I suspect I was overly relying on my quads. I recently heard a physical therapist say that for every 1 quad-focused exercise you do, you should do 2 posterior chain exercises to balance it out. I don’t know anything else about this advice but I do know that I wasn’t following it.\nInstead of the split squats, I started doing single-leg deadlifts and airplane deadlifts. My hamstrings got very flexible and strong. I started to notice that when I pick something off the floor I can hinge almost enough to touch the ground. I have a history of hamstring strains so this was a welcome improvement, ITBS aside.\nI started regularly attacking my TFL with a massage gun. I could never figure out the ITB/TFL stretches - I could get into position but I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to feel. But if you put a massage gun on your TFL, you’ll know you’re on it because you can feel your IT band vibrating distally on the side of the knee.\nI started working on hip mobility, and specifically hip internal rotation. Not knowing much about “internal rotation”, I feared it early in my ITBS after reading that ITBS can result from too much/uncontrolled knee rotation inward, which I thought was the same thing. When I tried the hip 90/90 mobility drill, my left (ITBS) hip was very uncomfortable when it was in the internally rotated position. My hip felt jammed up like something was going to break if I tried to stretch or sink into the position. I decided with nothing to lose I was going to work on this limitation, mostly by holding the position for a few minutes at a time, and gradually it got easier and less uncomfortable. I also started doing this posterior hip capsule stretch. I don’t know if any of this is related to my ITBS improvement or merely coincidental.\nLater update to the update (July 2025): I picked up a copy of Jay Dicharry’s Running Rewired and started doing the Foam Roller Drill (pg. 88) (also on Youtube). I knew this one was going to make a difference as soon as I tried it because it felt pretty different between my left and right sides and was more challenging on my ITBS side."

Be warned that it can provoke ITBS pain, though I only had (fleeting) pain with it once. After discovering this exercise in Sports Performance Bulletin, I was surprised to find very little further information about it beyond stray posts on some older forums and one blog post.\nSources: Sports Performance Bulletin, helpful photo guide here\n\n\nScraping\nIs it woo? I don’t know. I first learned about Graston scraping when I had a hamstring injury a couple of years ago and it gave me some relief then. At the time I had purchased a bow-shaped scraper similar to the one used in the Sidekick IT band scraping videos linked below.\nSources: Sidekick\n\n\nIT band strap\nMy ortho suggested I try running with an IT band strap. The reasoning is that pressure stabilizes the IT band so it can’t rub against the femur and cause pain. But it seems that this may not be the source of pain in ITBS anyway (see More fun reading, below). I did try the IT strap on a couple of runs and maybe coincidentally these runs were better than usual. I eventually got annoyed with the strap because it was frequently either too loose and sliding around a bit or squeezing my hamstring uncomfortably.\n\n\nSideways walking on a treadmill with incline\nAfter a treadmill incline walking session - which can be a great way to painlessly engage all of the running muscles without actually running - I have been following this tip to slow the treadmill down to ~1.3 mph, set the incline to 5%, and walk sideways for a couple of minutes on each side. I actually find this to be more challenging leading with my “good” side.\nSources: Runner’s World\n\n\nThe Balanced Runner lessons\nThe Balanced Runner (Jae Gruenke) has some free lessons for people struggling with IT band syndrome. These lessons are somewhat unusual in that you perform directed movements that are supposed to improve your running form, but the connections between the movements and running are not at all obvious. I found myself wanting the punchline after every instruction and the level of explanation was a bit dissatisfying. Still, I couldn’t help but notice that I did feel “better” in some mysterious way walking around after the lesson, which is why I link information about the lesson here.\nSources: The Balanced Runner"

During the worst weeks of my ITBS, I was having knee pain in the night that would wake me up. One time the pain was so bad that I rolled out of bed at 1:30am to book another appointment with my ortho. I found that I was able to switch to sleeping on the ITBS side and the pain stopped waking me up in the night. This probably varies a lot by case - I don’t have very much pressure sensitivity on the outside of my knee so I can rest on it comfortably, but others may not.\nIn any case, changing the side you sleep on, and by extension noticing and switching up any other asymmetrical postures you find yourself in for long stretches of time may be worth exploring.\n\n\nWalking backwards down stairs\nWalking down stairs backwards is how I’ve been getting down stairs. It’s much less painful than going down stairs the normal way. Try it."

My impression is that most of the general “IT band help” articles out there still state that the IT band moves/rubs against the femur but a handful do mention the fat pad as a source of pain."

It turns out this is irritation of the tibialis anterior or extensor tendons in the feet and is called “lace bite” among hockey players and runners.\nTwo changes got me out of lace-bite hell: I got and applied some sticky-backed cushion pads to the underside of the shoe tongues to protect the tops of my feet from the lace pressure (like these), and I started lacing my shoes differently after learning a bit about Arthur Lydiard. Lydiard was a coach who is best known for the concept of periodization in training. In his training manual (pdf), he dedicates a single paragraph to another concept he is known for - a shoe-lacing technique that has come to be known as Lydiard lacing.\nLydiard claimed in his manual and elsewhere that lacing in this way, with laces running in parallel straight across the eyelets, reduces pressure on the metatarsals. Is it true? And would this help with my lace bite, which is somewhat higher up on the foot near the ankle?"

    "title": "Digging in to my Garmin running dynamics data for 2024",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Training cycles\nIn 2024, I ran a total of 2404.7 miles over 338 days. The shape of my year was driven by two marathon training cycles: a 16-week cycle for the Eugene Marathon at the end of April (4/28/24), and an 18-week cycle for the Richmond Marathon held in November (11/16/2024).\n\nI followed Hal Higdon’s Advanced-1 training plan for Eugene and the Pfitzinger & Douglas 18 week/55 mpw plan for Richmond. Evident here, the Pfitz plan included several more medium-long runs in the 10-14 mile range than the Higdon plan did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning dynamics that determine pace\nIncreasing cadence and stride length will both increase speed, but people vary in how much they increase cadence and stride length to achieve a faster pace. In fact, some super shoes are marketed as being for “cadence runners” or “stride runners” depending on which strategy they tend to use to speed up! Ground contact time (GCT) is another component of the speed puzzle - how much time the foot stays in contact with the ground while running - with a shorter GCT freeing up time for forward motion.\nWe can see the relationship between these determinants of pace in these paired scatterplots. On the diagonal, the distributions of each running variable is shown, with the two off-diagonal panels for each pair showing a scatterplot and the correlation value. Note the strong negative relationships between cadence and pace, and stride length and pace, but the positive correlation between stride length and cadence. Higher cadences and longer strides are each associated with a lower (=faster) pace, and cadence and stride length tend to increase together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I a cadence- or stride-runner?\nTo compare the relative contributions of each of these factors to my pace, let’s build a model. I can’t do this without noting the huge statistical caveat here that these methods assume independence and my data are certainly not independent - there is likely correlation between successive runs, successive days and weeks, that is not being accounted for, so keep that in mind.\nTo put these variables on level-footing, I scaled them to see how a 1-standard deviation (1 SD) change in each would impact pace. Practically, this means we are looking at the impact of changing my cadence by about 7.5 steps/minute (1 SD of my cadence values), a 0.068 meter change in my stride length (1 SD of my stride length values), and a 12 millisecond change in my ground contact time (1 SD of GCT values).\nHowever, there’s another level of complexity to consider: these variables are pretty biomechanically entangled. For example, increasing cadence when steps are longer will result in a larger increase in pace than increasing cadence by the same amount at a shorter stride length. Additionally, a longer ground contact time could negate the benefits of increased cadence or stride length. All that to say, these variables interact. I fit two models, one with a three-way interaction between cadence, stride length, and GCT, along with all two-way interactions (i.e., cadence and stride length, cadence and GCT, GCT and stride length) and main effect terms, and a second model containing the two-way interactions and main effects. By using a likelihood ratio test, we learn that the addition of the three-way interaction term significantly improves the fit of the model, so we will use the model containing all possible interaction terms.\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: avg_pace_s ~ cadence * stride_len + cadence * gct + gct * stride_len\nModel 2: avg_pace_s ~ cadence * stride_len * gct\n  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq  Pr(>Chi)    \n1    345 9133.9                           \n2    344 7523.5  1    1610.4 < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nCoefficient estimates from the model containing all interaction terms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      term\n      estimate\n      std.error\n      statistic\n      p.value\n    \n  \n  \n    (Intercept)\n496.2886433\n0.2882150\n1721.938866\n0.000000e+00\n    cadence\n-22.2035147\n0.5471352\n-40.581402\n3.370489e-133\n    stride_len\n-31.5741006\n0.5142430\n-61.399183\n1.946863e-187\n    gct\n0.9776408\n0.3214425\n3.041417\n2.535488e-03\n    cadence:stride_len\n4.6286720\n0.2945853\n15.712504\n2.575984e-42\n    cadence:gct\n-1.8105891\n0.4906499\n-3.690185\n2.604265e-04\n    stride_len:gct\n1.1373101\n0.3761488\n3.023565\n2.685796e-03\n    cadence:stride_len:gct\n-0.9041686\n0.1053684\n-8.581022\n3.278699e-16\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nTo try to answer the question about whether an increase in cadence or stride length improves speed more, the interpretation of the model coefficients isn’t straightforward with all of the interaction terms. But we can use the model to get the estimated paces under several scenarios: my typical cadence and stride length, +1 SD to my cadence (i.e., 7.5 more steps/minute) at typical stride length, typical cadence at +1 SD to my stride length (strides 0.068 meters longer), and +1 SD to both my cadence and stride length (all of these at my typical GCT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Scenario\n      Estimated pace (min/mi)\n      Lower 95% CI\n      Upper 95% CI\n    \n  \n  \n    Normal cadence, normal stride length\n8.27\n8.26\n8.28\n    +1 SD cadence, normal stride length\n7.90\n7.88\n7.92\n    Normal cadence, +1 SD stride length\n7.74\n7.72\n7.77\n    +1 SD cadence, +1 SD stride length\n7.45\n7.43\n7.47\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nFrom this, we see that I’m slightly a stride-runner, but the best results occur when both cadence and stride length are increased.\n\n\n\nMore about ground contact time\nI held ground contact time constant in the pace model because isn’t really voluntarily controlled like cadence and stride length are. However, there are cues and training that you can use to improve it in general. I tried to implement a couple techniques this year: a simple plyometrics routine and a form cue to drive the feet downward when running, letting forward swing be passive after hip extension (like a slingshot - Steve Magness). I was happy to see my GCT gradually decrease after I started trying to improve it around March.\n\n\n\n\n\nInexplicably, my GCT started to get worse in the weeks before and especially after the Richmond Marathon. On many of these runs, both tapering and then slowly resuming running, I was telling myself to slow down. This was especially frustrating during the taper, because I felt fresh and couldn’t seem to reign it in. I imagine that actively trying to slow down caused me to increase my GCT. I do wonder if changing mechanics set the stage for my ITBS, which started in late December."

    "text": "My history with training plans\nFor my first marathon, the Eugene Marathon in April 2024, I used Hal Higdon’s Advanced-1 plan. This was my first time following a training plan of any type, though I only really followed the marathon pace workouts and the long run progression, letting myself fill the rest of the week with whatever easy mileage I desired rather than the miles stipulated by HH. I also included one weekly threshold run that included 20 minutes at threshold. On the weeks of the 20-milers, my weekly mileage reached just over 55 miles, with most other weeks being somewhere in the 45-52 mile range.\nThe race went well enough for a first time - I finished, I didn’t get injured, I qualified for Boston (!) - but I felt my pace slow in the last 4 miles and I was interested in ways to overcome this. I had read about plans that combine marathon pace work with long runs and I thought this approach might help. A little searching brought me to Advanced Marathoning by Pfitzinger & Douglas, a book of training plans beloved by the folks over at r/AdvancedRunning.\nI decided to follow a so-called “Pfitz” plan for my second marathon, which was the Richmond Marathon held in November. I chose the 18-week 55 mile plan, which peaks at 55 miles per week (mpw) but starts much lower at 33 mpw. I had been running ~40 mpw for about 7 years before I started training for Eugene, and was back to a base level of 45 mpw before training for Richmond. For the first few weeks of the plan, which were lower in mileage, I followed the plan workouts and added easy miles as needed to stay at or above my 45 mpw base until the plan’s increasing weekly mileage caught up to my own.\nPfitz 18/55 was a great plan. I followed the workouts, but like my experience with HH, I didn’t stringently follow the miles scheduled on easy/recovery days because (I don’t really think it matters and) I like flexibility. I also didn’t follow the tune-up races with long runs, simply because I keep my running week Sunday - Saturday (Pfitz plans are written Monday - Sunday) and there are no races on Fridays, at least where I live. My favorite part of the Pfitz plan was the inclusion of mid-week medium-long runs of 11-12 miles - I felt like these really helped my endurance. I questioned the weekly VO2max track work in the final weeks of the plan and often only completed 1/2 of the reps and then hit my local hill for some strides. All in all, the plan delivered and I shaved 13 minutes off of my Eugene time. The last 6 miles were among my fastest, too, which was what I was hoping to achieve with Pfitz."

    "text": "What am I going to do differently this time?\nIn adding easy miles to Pfitz 18/55, my peak mileage reached 65 mpw and I had 3-4 weeks around 58-62 mpw. The next step up in the Pfitz plan series are the 70 mpw peak plans (18/70 and 12/70). For Boston, I plan to follow the 18/70 plan. I didn’t feel overly fatigued or ever struggle to complete workouts in the 18/55 plan, even with the additional mileage and ending most long runs with a decent chunk at marathon pace. I’m nervous to add mileage because I’m terribly afraid of injury but excited to make the leap and see how much adding volume makes a difference in my time.\nStill, I can’t seem to follow a plan without putting my own spin on it, so I’m going to make some modifications:\n\nThis plan includes doubles, but it’s not high enough mileage to warrant doubles (imo) so I’m not going to do the doubles. Scheduled doubles are 6 miles am + 4 miles pm. I’ll probably just run between 6-10 miles and call it good enough.\nI scaled the total weekly miles down just a bit by multiplying each week by a factor of 67.5/70. So, I’ll actually peak at 67.5 mpw, and several weeks will be in the 63-66 mpw range. As for where to reduce miles to achieve this, I’ll reference the 18/55 plan and make sure I don’t change any workouts that are conserved between the plans (e.g., the LT/threshold workouts are identical between the plans, with the 18/70 LT workouts including 1 additional non-LT easy mile). I’m likely to drop a mile from a mid-week 15 miler, or a mile or two from a recovery run."

    "text": "What about strength work?\nFor the past couple years I have been in a good groove with strength training and generally train 3x per week following shorter runs. There are different perspectives on when to schedule strength work, but a more common viewpoint is that “easy days should be easy, and hard days should be hard”, i.e. do strength training after speedwork or an otherwise hard run. I’m not going to challenge this directly, but over time I have found myself favoring strength work on short days for reasons of both time management and load management.\nOne of the challenges of Pfitz 18/70 vs 18/55 is the number and placement of the workout days (by which I mean anything that isn’t a recovery run). Generally, 18/70 has 4-5 workout days per week, and most of these are medium-long or long runs. I generally don’t have time to add 30-50 minutes of strength work after 1h30 - 2h of running. But it’s also said that strength work shouldn’t take place the day before speedwork or a long run, which knocks out most of the days of the week.\nI’m tentatively going to continue doing strength work on recovery days, because it has worked for me this far and I’m almost never sore to a point that my running is compromised. I’ll probably do a post about strength training at some point because I’ve come to really enjoy it."
