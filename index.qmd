Hello and welcome! I'm Alex Hughes and Cauchy's Lap is my running blog. 

During the day I'm a statistician at Virginia Commonwealth University. I have a PhD in Neuroscience and an MS in Statistics, and I carry that academic energy into running. Cauchy is my heavy-tailed nebelung cat pictured above - I like to run laps, but he prefers to sit in them.

An impetus for starting this blog was a particularly bad case of IT band syndrome I had in the first half of 2025. I was desperate to read stories from others who had dealt with this condition and I wasn't satisfied with the limited number of personal accounts that were turning up in my searches. I decided I would contribute my own story and anything else running-related that I felt like writing about. Thanks for stopping by!
